## Update
To update the template, just repeat step 1.

# Default Language
To change the default language, just refer to the end of the code in the html file and select the desired language in the select tag. Example:
```
<select id="countries" class="border text-sm rounded-lg focus:ring-blue-500 focus:border-blue-500 block w-full p-2.5 bg-gray-700 border-gray-600 placeholder-gray-400 text-white :focus:ring-blue-500 :focus:border blue-500">
  <option value="en">English</option>
  <option value="fa">فارسی</option>
  <option value="ru">Русский</option>
</select>
```
In this example, the main language is English.

# Personalization
To personalize the Telegram ID, background image and user logo, changes must be included in the html file, which is possible by searching for some values.
To search using nano, first open the file with nano with the following command:
```
nano /var/lib/marzban/templates/subscription/index.html
```
Then open the search bar with Ctrl + W combination buttons and search for the following phrase to change Telegram support ID:
```
https://t.me/yourID
```
Search for the user's logo:
```
images/marzban.svg
```
Search for the background image:
```
background: url('https://4kwallpapers.com
```
After making changes, save the file and restart Marzban.

## Host Version
To use the host version, upload the sub folder to the host and change the value of BASE_URL to your panel address in the index.php file just like the following example. Remember to write http if you don't have an SSL for your panel domain.
```
const BASE_URL = "https://BaseUrl:PORT";
```
